## Usage Guide

### For Users

1. **Depositing Tokens**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .bridge deposit-tokens)
   ```

2. **Initiating a Cross-Chain Transfer**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .bridge initiate-cross-chain-transfer 
       u1000000 
       'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7 
       u2)
   ```

3. **Withdrawing Tokens**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .bridge withdraw-tokens u1000000)
   ```

### For Administrators

1. **Initializing the Bridge**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .bridge initialize-bridge)
   ```

2. **Managing Relayers**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .bridge register-relayer 'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7)
   ```

3. **Emergency Controls**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .bridge pause-bridge-operations)
   (contract-call? .bridge resume-bridge-operations)
   ```

### For Relayers

1. **Confirming Transfers**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .bridge confirm-cross-chain-transfer 
       u1 
       0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef)
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Multi-Relayer Verification**
   - Transfers require multiple confirmations from authorized relayers
   - Configurable threshold for required confirmations
   - Protection against single relayer compromise

2. **Pausable Operations**
   - Emergency pause mechanism for all bridge operations
   - Only contract owner can pause/unpause
   - Protection against ongoing attacks

3. **Balance Protection**
   - Strict balance checking before transfers
   - Prevention of overflow/underflow
   - Minimum transfer amount enforcement

4. **Access Control**
   - Owner-only administrative functions
   - Authorized relayer system
   - Clear separation of roles

## Error Handling

The contract includes comprehensive error handling with specific error codes:
- u100: Owner-only access violation
- u101: Invalid parameters provided
- u102: Insufficient balance
- u103: Unauthorized access attempt
- u104: Invalid bridge operational status
- u105: Transfer request not found
- u106: Invalid chain ID
- u107: Below minimum transfer amount
- u108: Duplicate confirmation attempt

## Best Practices

1. **For Users**
   - Always verify recipient addresses before transfers
   - Ensure sufficient balance before initiating transfers
   - Wait for required confirmations before considering transfer complete

2. **For Administrators**
   - Regularly rotate relayer addresses
   - Monitor bridge status and transfer patterns
   - Maintain a list of trusted relayers

3. **For Relayers**
   - Verify transfer details before confirmation
   - Maintain secure private keys
   - Monitor for suspicious transfer patterns
